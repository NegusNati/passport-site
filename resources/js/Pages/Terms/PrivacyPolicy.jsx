                                Like many other websites, we use cookies to
                                identify you as a user and to customize and
                                improve our services. A cookie is a small data
                                file that is transferred to your computer or
                                mobile device. It enables us to remember your
                                account log-in information, IP addresses, web
                                traffic, number of times you visit, date, and
                                time of visits. Some browsers may automatically
                                accept cookies while some can be modified to
                                decline cookies or alert you when a website
                                wants to place a cookie on your computer. If you
                                do choose to disable cookies, it may limit your
                                ability to use our website.

                                We will only retain personal information on our

                                Once an account has been deactivated, your
                                information is stored on our servers for as long
                                as necessarily obligated by law.
